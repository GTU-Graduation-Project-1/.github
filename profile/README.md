This study addresses optimizing waste cleanup operations following large-scale
 disasters, aiming to minimize total cost and time. A mathematical model is developed
 to address aspects like building demolition, waste collection, processing at temporary
 disaster waste management sites (TDWMS) and vehicle routes to final disposal sites.
 The model is a mixed integer programming (MIP). The model is implemented using
 CPLEX with Python. To show how the model works, a graphical user interface
 is developed. This GUI has a heatmap feature that visualizes the frequency of route
 usages and offers insights to decision makers for planning and executing strategies. The
 results show that combining demolition schedules with waste collection and transport
 plans is very important. This helps reduce costs and save time.
