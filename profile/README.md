## Overview  
This study addresses optimizing waste cleanup operations following large-scale disasters, aiming to minimize total cost and time. A mathematical model is developed to address aspects like:  

- **Building demolition**  
- **Waste collection**  
- **Processing at Temporary Disaster Waste Management Sites (TDWMS)**  
- **Vehicle routes to final disposal sites**  

The model is a **Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)** approach, implemented using **CPLEX with Python**.  

## Features  
- A **graphical user interface (GUI)** is developed to demonstrate the model's functionality.  
- The **heatmap visualization** feature displays the frequency of route usage, providing insights for decision-makers.  

## Key Findings  
The results show that combining **demolition schedules** with **waste collection and transport plans** is crucial. This integration helps reduce costs and save time, making disaster recovery efforts more efficient.
